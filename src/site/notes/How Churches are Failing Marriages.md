In the last article, [[Why is marriage like the church?\|Why is marriage like the church?]], I wrote that the *purpose* of the church is wrapped up in the *message* behind marriages. 

If the *primary* purpose of the church body is to represent and declare the Gospel, then Gospel-reflecting marriages (amongst those for whom marriage is meant for -- respecting and understanding that some people have a gift of singleness) should be a close second.

**Why, then, are churches failing marriages?**

While the data is unclear, the divorce rate amongst Christian married couples likely is not significantly lower than that amongst secular couples.

While the success rate of marriages can't be placed *entirely* at the foot of the Church, the converse is also true: the Church can't be released of all responsibility.

It's like a business: the operators of the business can't foresee and mitigate *all* the difficulties that they may encounter -- economic shocks, technology shifts, new competitors, for example -- it *is* fair to say that if a business, year after year, is losing money, losing customers, losing market presence that *something* is wrong.

There are, in fact, businesses that thrive despite challenges -- fires, floods, competitors, theft, illness -- because they *do* approach things with the right mind and take the right actions.

So we can't let the church abdicate *some* role in advancing perhaps the most foundational institution.

Churches have a home-field advantage: most people get married *in a church* -- even many who are unchurched and unbelievers end up in a church to get married.

Many married couples make decisions to *join* a church when they have kids. Even if the underlying reason is not necessarily an expression of faith, it still happens.

In a world of fallen humans, a world which applies to churches and their leaders, what is the correlation between failure and success that appears universal? In other words, when something consistently fails, what is often missing?

There are several.

One of those is *caring about the problem or person*.

When the business really cares about the business outcome, effort follows. Not all effort may be good or right, which we'll get to, but very rarely will a business succeed if people don't care.

When an individual really cares about their health and fitness, they tend to be fit; similarly, they may take longer, they may not be reaching the goals they have defined for themselves, but they are unlikely to trend to the *opposite* of being healthy.

When a hospital really cares about the recovery rate of their patients, it shows in the attention to detail, speed of service, quality of the doctors and nurses.  When they don't, patients increase in their rate of infections or death.

There are rare instances where someone *really* cares and the outcomes are the same as if someone doesn't care. Those instances might be in the case where someone is ignorant or knows the wrong things, which I will talk about.

But the first question is, regardless of the outcome, does the church --- does *your* church -- really care about marriage....about **your** marriage?

What is one outcome of the degree of care?

It's the degree of effort?

Jesus cares -- he cares more than any human is capability of caring for humanity -- because of the degree of effort -- dying at the cross such that we may have true life.

If your job matters to you -- maybe not because you love it, you may hate it, but you care about what you are able to do for your family as a result of it -- you put in effort.

What is the level of effort your church devotes to marriage?

How would you measure this?

Well, I would look at the primary outputs of a church and ask, "How much of this is dedicated towards creating healthy foundations to marriage?"

What are those outputs?

1. A weekly sermon -- 1-2 hours long.  How many total hours are on the topic?
2. Small group content -- How many hours are on the topic?
3. Ministry and evangelism -- How many people are devoted to this as a part of evangelism and ministry?
4. Leaders training -- How much training have the elders received so that they are able to augment marriage counseling?
5. Budgets -- How much of the budget is allocated to marriage-related activities?

### But what about marriage ministries?
There *are* some good marriage ministries!

In fact, I would include my writing and teaching as one of them.

The problem is these are often treated as *supplemental* -- and as such, aren't a concerted effort by either you or your church.

Your church may once a year invite a speaker.  That's good (depending on the speaker).

But is it enough?

Often, these ministries are treated as para-ministries that parachute into a church, deliver a workshop, and depart.

So back to signs of importance: if a surgeon that was about to operate on you said that their preparation was to drop into a heart surgery workshop once or twice a year, how would you feel?

Marriage is heart surgery.

And the level of preparation, investment, and *care* is minimal.

So now that I've set the table for what *you* should look for and look *out* for within your existing church, I'll let the second shoe drop.

I mentioned earlier that there is at least *one* benefit to the church's abdication of marriages as a priority.

In other words, it's actually *good* that they haven't been spending the time and effort to do so.

It's because they largely will say and do the *wrong* things!

It's good that the effort has been substandard, because the content is often misleading at best, damaging to your marriage at worse.

This gets to the heart of the way churches are failing marriages, and I continue that in the next article [[How Churches are Failing Marriages - Part 2\|How Churches are Failing Marriages - Part 2]]
