Dwelling on the small things is another way to imprison your mind.

The world fuels your blind pursuit of the trivial and the petty:

- The specks you see in other peoples eyes without looking at the depths of your own sins. 

- The slights and offenses from other people for expectations we place silently on their heads.

- The desires, competitiveness, and jealousies for temporal symbols that feed the pride of life.

When I let someone's offensive comment or disrespectful behavior govern my thoughts over and over, I am imprisoning my mind. I replay over and over of what was said, what I want to tell that person, and why that person is being so horrible.

"That person is a sociopath who can't do his own job well, so he needs to complain about me to other people behind my back. Why can't he just do what he needs to do and have an adult conversation with me directly?"

I may be right.  But I've imprisoned myself within those thoughts.

When my wife gets upset and emotional over details that bother her more than me -- the time we set the dish washer to turn on, whether an item was thrown away should have been recycled, when a child's homework assignment didn't mark as wrong an incorrect answer -- she builds up over and over a narrative: "You don't care; you are incompetent; you can't do what I ask you to do."

She imprisons her thoughts with the narrative of resentment.

I, in turn, can respond by imprisoning myself in the resulting shame.

Around and around we spin this web.

I'm not saying *all* difficult or onerous things are petty.  

Paying the bills on time needs regular attention.  

Reviewing the fine-print of a contract before signing, listening to a doctor's recommendations for your child, evaluating finances and investments -- those deserve responsible behavior.

Being responsible is not the same as dwelling on the petty and the trivial.

The more we spend on things that don't matter, are perishable, and suck out real life, the more we shackle our own minds.

Even the things that seemingly put us in a good spirit can handcuff our thoughts and spirit: a bigger home, a nicer car, a bigger salary, a respectable title.

What, then, is an antidote to this kind of enslavement?

**Your mind is free when it is a slave of Christ.**[^2]

Being a slave of Christ is not about religious behaviors and habits.  

I know a church elder who makes choices and gives wisdom seeking the approval of man.  He makes career choices to please his peers.  And he adjusts Scripture in order to be well-liked by the congregation.  

He is not a slave of Christ.

Freedom from the world comes from enslavement to one greater than the world.[^1]

When we view events and behaviors through our purpose in Christ, we strip naked the trivial and recoil from the petty.

The trivial kills, steals and destroys the love and passion for exploring our purpose according to Gods will. 

Thoughts captive and obedient to Christ that will push back on the subtle and relentless thoughts of the world because they evaluate whether doing so fits their mission.

A mission found in Christ remembers to love the evil people who slap our face and steal our clothes.[^3]

A mission found in Christ rejects the traps of the Law and self-righteousness.

A mission found in Christ looks at priorities and actions that advance the world knowing the true Gospel and works from God's true Word, not by parroting a popular line from a pastor.

The truth will set you free. 

Not your truth. Not majority opinion from the world. Not the newscaster. Not a platitude from church.

The Truth from God in Word and Spirit!
