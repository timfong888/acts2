Does your mind need to be set free?

You probably think this is a very strange idea.

Or...perhaps deep down, you have been wondering where you get your thoughts and ideas from.

Scripture is clear on what such a freed mind could look like.

"Do not conform to the patterns of the world."

And yet....I see many Christians of "high standing" who, other than their Sunday attendance or titles within the church, are **exactly** like the world in behavior, thinking, and priorities.

Does this have an impact on their salvation?

I wouldn't dare speculate on behalf of someone else.

But...you are, in fact, invited to test yourself.

This study will be a journey that could:

- Unleash a new view of the world
- Challenge your own personal conventions and programming
- Give you a new freedom that is both scary and exhilarating

## But...do you want to free your mind?

Even Christians who are faithful church goers may not want to free their mind.

After all, religion is often a **tradition**. Jesus calls out the Pharisees:

> You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men. (Mark 7:8)

Tradition is not what Jesus wants wants for us, because it ties us down to the things of man and the world.

From my experience, the religiously devoted to their traditions **fear** freeing their mind.

The downside is conformity to the ways or patterns of the world.

Traditions make those worldly patterns comfortable. Acceptable. Moral. High-status.

This is why they are hard to break.

## Beauty of a freed mind

A freed mind is a beautiful mind.

I truly believe that freeing your mind may start being uncomfortable.

But on the other side, you'll find beauty, grace, solace, and most importantly, Jesus.

The world's patterns aren't meant for you, although they seem that way.

The world's patterns conspire to conform your thinking in its ways.

Jesus desires you to know God's ways, the Kingdom's ways.

It becomes a choice. You can't serve two masters.

Ready for the journey?

Listen to my extended messages recorded above.

I also take questions and answer them on my podcast.
