[[Saturday, July 27th, 2024\|Saturday, July 27th, 2024]]

Have you see the sitcom where there's a bumbling doctor or dentist who really wants to take care of the patient...and is trying really hard, but actually ends up *harming* the person under their care?

I don't remember the details, but the image is in my mind: bumping the patient in the head, twisting their broken arm accidentally, dropping all matter of equipment.

But the doctor is *trying really hard* to take care of the patient.

It's just that *effort* is only *one part of the equation* for outcome in the secular world.

The other side is competence.

To me, Jesus is the ultimate expression of both. Sacrificing himself to be killed at the cross to save all who choose to place their faith of him -- that's effort that very few can replicate.

But that sacrifice wouldn't mean anything if it didn't *actually* result in victory over sin and death.

Jesus had the ultimate *competence*: he could solve the most intractable problem and accomplish the unbelievable rescue.

So what is the level of competence of churches with marriages?

Low.  

Why is it low?

I'll go into more detail about the sources of this, but first, we need to examine the symptoms.

What makes me believe most marriage efforts *are* incompetent?

The problem with competence is we must have a standard -- what *is* competence?

For example, for a heart surgeon, there are standard, proven procedures that have years of history showing successful outcomes. There might be new risky procedures that push the envelope that can *also* be a sign of competence, but existing procedures form a base-line.

Someone who knew *nothing* about those things or couldn't do those procedures out of experience and training would be incompetent.

As I'll share later, there *are* some truths and foundations which can be followed when it comes to marriages, and these likely *are not* followed in most churches.  I'll talk about this because this is the actual foundation of competence: following the known and true.

However, if a heart surgeon followed the practices of a known quack, of someone who had been disproven, of someone who had a string of failures, that *also* could be a signal of incompetence.

And it is on this thread that I'll share.

Warning: this may shock and scare you, because the conventions in many churches are often mistakenly accepted as good and healthy turns out, to not be.

The first is a focus on *feelings*.  How do people.

...

### Why is it like this?
We've seen two sources of the problem in many churches when it comes to marriages.

The first was insufficient *caring*: it's not a priority, judging on time, effort, and resources.

Look at the % of hours in sermons, ministry, outreach, and community building.

This shows the amount of effort.

The second is *competence*: what is being taught and practiced in favor of marriages?

This second one is debatable *if* one has varying opinions on what makes competence, which is often the cause.

But what is one thing which ties the two together, the one thing which, if used as the basis, could steer the ship?

*Doctrine*.

Unfortunately, doctrine is the furthest from most people's minds when it comes to relational things.

Doctrine has been kicked into the dusty bin for theologians and divinity school, for tweed-wearing intellectuals and King James quoting fire-and-brimstone preachers.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">**However, without doctrine, *What do we have?"**</mark>

Jesus *is* the Word.  Jesus *is* the Truth.

> “Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’” - John 14:6

Jesus is the Truth, and doctrine is the means in which believers converge upon the Truth by relying upon the Word.

> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made… The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.” -- **John 1:1-3, 14**
