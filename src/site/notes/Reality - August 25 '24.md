[[Sunday, August 25th, 2024\|Sunday, August 25th, 2024]]

Today's sermon from Dave Lomas was about money, and it is refreshing to hear it; partly because I feel the topic largely escapes the pulpit, but also because I can also benefit from it.

Here, his focus is on how **greed hides itself** illustrated by Keller saying that no one has ever come to him to confess to greed.

No one thinks themselves greedy.  But Jesus refers to money as a God, a demon, and one can only serve one master, not two.

He rightly points out that wealth is not the problem: there have been very important figures, such as Lydia, who were wealthy.

But money is not a neutral tool.

It is a means to something else, to the other things of life, and in this way, is a rival to God.

It's a source of status, identity, revenge, security, moral regeneration, control -- all of these things can come from money.

Conversion to jesus is to turn over heart, mind, and bank account, the most difficult of which i the bank account.

### My own thoughts
In a secular podcast (although the guest shared that he was a Christian), giving was supposed to have a high correlation to income; the reason was that giving away money made one into a problem solver, and this led to growth in income.

I think this is likely true: giving should increase and become a part of what one does because it will result in more returns.
