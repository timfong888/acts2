Pastors like to facilitate communication, and believe that this will solve the problem.

Unfortunately, it will only lead to the deterioration of the marriage [[Communication Facilitation is a Fraud\|Communication Facilitation is a Fraud]].

The right way is to not have the wife see her husband as the enemy, and in many cases, vice versa (although it's not always this case -- pastors want to make things always 50/50 and end up bringing death [[Splitting the Baby in Half\|Splitting the Baby in Half]].

Who is the real enemy?

The first one is the culture.

The culture will instill perspectives, beliefs, ideologies -- and unless the pastor is able to detect and persuade against these things > [!bible] [Romans 12:2 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/45/12/)
> 2. Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.

Then you are truly dead.

Before you even got started.

The culture says that women's feelings **are** reality.

That "submitting" to a husband is wrong now that she can make her own money.

Why do they do this?  Why don't pastors try to establish the principles and foundations to fight fair *before* marriages go bad?

The best way is to gain agreement on the role of anger and rights of women.
