**[[Wednesday, September 18th, 2024\|Wednesday, September 18th, 2024]]**

When my wife raged, the pastor would just jump to her side, say what I was saying was wrong or unjust, or ask me to answer, "how do you feel about how she's feeling?"

Yet, the damage I felt from my wife's choices and actions was **ignored**...even in one and one with him, he didn't want to deal with it.  He told me to not deal with it either.

Why?

Many women are angry...and like my wife, she said it's because of something I did...but she can't communicate what it is.

Women's rage is a massive problem...but it is unlikely to be fixed, because all of them think they are justified.

My wife could yell, scream, and yell back about how justified it is for her and all of her friends.

In the church, the primary source to address this is also biblical, and most churches fail.  It is older women, which falls upon the Pastor's Wife.  

Many men....have mother's who had rage.

I did.  My pastor did.  My wife does.

Angry, raging mothers who lose control impact their children who carry this with them.

And it's hard to expose.

I tried with the pastor who was our counselor and asked him directly, "Is it possible you are bringing in issues around an alcoholic mother into our sessions?"

He denied it.  Said he was fine.

But the angry spouse wife **still** controls the sessions.

Are there men who are, in fact, angry?

Yes. 

And they **definitely** need to have separate session.  An angry man who is emotional is essentially controlled by a female spirit.  And he has a longer, deeper journey to figure his stuff out.

But most men don't have the same explosive, emotional rage that women have.

And if we apply game theory, who will always win?

Most pastors, especially those attracted to becoming pastors because of its therapeutic role, versus it's truth-seeking role, will be afraid of women's rage.  So they will behave as my pastor did, which is to seek a false peace [[False Peace - The Lie that Enslaves\|False Peace - The Lie that Enslaves]], and end up letting the woman's feeling drive the man's reality.

When a woman gets angry at the therapist, I can guarantee you, they will not return.

If a woman is angry at the husband for not wanting to go to a therapist, they will go to the therapist.

If a man gets angry at the woman for wanting to go to the therapist, the man will go to jail or go to the therapist.

Once in the clutches of the therpauetic pastor, truth will take a back seat to the wife's emotions; and the man will be put into a position of pure shame.

There will almost never be an effort to restore the husband in the face of an onslaught by a woman.

Why?

Because the pastor or therapists frames the battle as between husband and wife.

He remains as "neutral" as possible and does what mine does: just facilitate communication [[Communication Facilitation is a Fraud\|Communication Facilitation is a Fraud]].

What should they do instead?

[[Direct Husband and Wife to Face their Real Enemy\|Direct Husband and Wife to Face their Real Enemy]]

Want to know who this real enemy is and why pastors are so fearful of making this statement (and how you can find pastors or programs that really do this?)
