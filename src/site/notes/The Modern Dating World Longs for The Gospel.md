Most non Christians wouldn't admit this, but the modern dating scene longs for the Gospel.

From the way most people appear to talk about it or treat it, Jesus is furthest from their minds.

But I think the need grows and becomes more apparent in proportion to desperation.

![[Psalm 30.mp3]]

And there's desperation now, one that the Christian world must take notice.

One, young Christians who have not been given an alternate model may find themselves lured into the current worldview.

Second, as modern people, who have grow numb to degeneracy over the years, open their eyes to what is occurring and directly affecting themselves, their openness to rescue widens.

### What is the problem?


### How has the Church responded?
In many cases (I don't have large-scale data, but would love to find a way to get some), the Church has not effectively responded to this challenge.

This doesn't mean that there haven't been efforts in some pockets to do something.

But I would argue that the Church has been slow to see the tide change and address it for their local congregations, as well as the broader societal impact.

I reflected on this problem 10 years ago, when the dating scene isn't nearly as desperate and challenging as it is now.

At the time, the reason I proposed was that many church leaders don't relate to the problem.  They married young, met their significant other doing ministry, and the scope and depth of the problem has remained largely out of sight.
